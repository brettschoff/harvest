# HARVEST HOMESTEAD

Our farming resource app provides admin users with the ability to add animals, crops, and equipment with photos and relevant information. We have designed the app to allow admin users to perform these functions from the application site rather than just the admin section, ensuring that users can enjoy the full range of application features.

While the general public can access our page and information, they can only participate in the community by creating a personal account. With a personal account, users can create their own profiles and add their farm names as well as any animals they currently own or intend to acquire.

The app also features a comment section for each element in our resources. Users can create new suggestion comments under their username and delete any comments that belong to them.
